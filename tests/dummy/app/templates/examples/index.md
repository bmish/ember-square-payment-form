# Ember Payment Form Examples

To help you get started, we've made 3 examples of how to use the Square Payment Form
in your app.

- {{link-to "Styled Payment Form - Light Theme" "examples.light"}}
- {{link-to "Styled Payment Form - Dark Theme" "examples.light"}}
- {{link-to "Unstyled Payment Form" "examples.unstyled"}}

If you're looking to get up and running quickly, we recommend you start with our styled payment form.
The styled payment form is quick to implement, looks great, and lets you focus on implementing the
server-side component of taking a payment with Square.

If you do want to customize your form, go for the unstyled payment form. It has an example of a payment form
with no custom styling applied, and is a great starting point for your app.
